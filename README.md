### Rolling Colors

# Gameplay

In Rolling Colors you take control of a ball that you move by rolling and jumping around the levels. The movement is all physics based so it can be a bit tricky to get the hang of but it very satisfying when you do. The main feature of the game is the fact that if you touch a block that you don't match colors with then you are reset to your last checkpoint. There are also abilities that you can unlock in the HUB area if you have collected enough coins in the other levels.

# Story

Rolling Colors is about a ball named Grey who has just been brought into existence (that's you!). Shortly after being born Grey meets the Avatar for the color Green, who's name is also Green (very creative I know). Green tells Grey that they and the other Avatars have been imprisoned by the shades in their attempt to take over everything. So Grey must absorb each of the three colors: Green, Blue and Red so that they can free the Avatars and together defeat the shades and restore balance to the land.
